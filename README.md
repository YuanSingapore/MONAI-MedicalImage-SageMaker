# MONAI-MedicalImage-SageMaker

This repository contains examples and related resources showing you how to you can use deep learning algorithms from MONAI libries to train models and conduct inference using Amazon SageMaker with Nring Your Own Script (BROS) model. 


 
  
# Overview
We demo the capability of using MONAI in Amazon SageMaker to transform, train the images and then annotate the medical images automatically. This repo adapt from 2 examples from [MONAI project](https://github.com/Project-MONAI), specifically on the [MONAI tutorials](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/tutorials)

# Repository Structure

+ Segementation 
  Segmentation of spleen from 3D CT images, which are captured in NIFTI format.
